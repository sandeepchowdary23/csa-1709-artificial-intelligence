% Base case: the sum of integers from 1 to 1 is 1
sum(1, 1).

% Recursive case: sum of integers from 1 to N is N + sum of integers from 1 to N-1
sum(N, Result) :-
    N > 1, % Ensure that N is greater than 1
    N1 is N - 1, % Decrement N
    sum(N1, PartialSum), % Recursively sum the first N-1 integers
    Result is N + PartialSum. % Add N to the partial sum
