% Base case: Moving 1 disk from the source peg to the destination peg
move(1, Source, Destination, _) :-
    write('Move disk from '), write(Source), write(' to '), write(Destination), nl.

% Recursive case: Move N disks from Source to Destination using Auxiliary peg
move(N, Source, Destination, Auxiliary) :-
    N > 1,                          % Ensure there are more than 1 disk
    M is N - 1,                      % Sub-problem: Move N-1 disks
    move(M, Source, Auxiliary, Destination), % Move N-1 disks to Auxiliary peg
    move(1, Source, Destination, _),         % Move the largest disk to Destination
    move(M, Auxiliary, Destination, Source). % Move N-1 disks from Auxiliary to Destination
